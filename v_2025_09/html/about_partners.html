    <h4>Partners and Project Background</h4>
    <p>The HAB Monitoring data shared on this dashboard are the result of a collaborative effort between
        the Water Boards and Restore the Delta. This monitoring program aims to
        address the growing concern over HABs in the Delta region raised by community organizations and tribes.

    <h5><i>Restore the Delta</i></h5>
    <p>
        Restore the Delta (RTD) is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to ensure the health of the San
        Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary and Delta Communities. RTD established their HABs monitoring program in 2021 in an
        effort to increase awareness of HABs alongside other water quality issues in the Delta. Restore the Delta
        manages all aspects of field work for this monitoring program ranging from recruiting and training field staff,
        to collecting water samples and field data.

    <h5><i>Central Valley Water Board</i></h5>
    <p>
        Adressing HABs in the City of Stockton Waters was formalized as a Central Valley
        Water Board (CVWB) priority in the 2021 Triennial Review (
        <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/water_issues/basin_plans/triennial_reviews/2021tr/2021tr_ssj_wrkpln_fnl.pdf"

            Project 30
        </a>
        ). The first steps for this project as outlined in the Triennial Review were for CVWB staff to establish
        partnerships with community members and stakeholders and to identify funding resources. Central Valley Water
        Board began a HAB monitoring partnership with Restore the Delta in 2022. Funding sources for laboratory analysis
        of HAB samples have included the Central Valley Water Board, State Water Board Freshwater and
        Estuarine Harmful Algal Bloom (FHAB) Program and the Division of Water Rights.

    <p>
        The Central Valley Water Board created this dashboard to share laboratory microcystin data from this monitoring
        program with the public and other agencies. Statewide HAB recreational advisories can be found on the Water
        Board's

    </p>

    <h5><i>State Water Resources Control Board</i></h5>
    <p>
        Multiple divisions within the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) have funded laboratory analysis of
        HAB samples for this monitoring program. In 2022 and 2023, funding for cyanotoxin laboratory analysis was
        provided
        by both the Central Valley Water Board and the State Water Board FHAB Program. Beginning in 2024, laboratory
        funding has been fully provided by the State Water Board Division of Water Rights.
