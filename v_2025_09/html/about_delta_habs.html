    <h4>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the Delta</h2>

            Awareness around issues related to HABs in the Delta has increased in recent years. This monitoring program
            is one of many efforts to characterize and understand HABs in the Delta that is being undertaken by tribes,
            community groups, nonprofit organizations, state, federal, and county agencies and academics.
